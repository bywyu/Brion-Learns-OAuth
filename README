This is an example of using the Signpost OAuth library in and Android application. It provides the basics of authentication via the Twitter OAuth service, then allows the student to enter Twitter messages into the authenticated user's stream.

You have to register your application with Twitter to get the Consumer Key and Secret. This has changed recently, so there are instructions for "old" app keys where there was no way to register a real callback address with Twitter, and the new method, where the Twitter application registration page prompts you to email them to get your application's callback address registered.

The way that callbacks are handled in the software differs, depending of whether the callback address you register is for your app, or was a space-filling external website address (like what I did). 

I will be addressing this issue very soon in the code and will end up with two branches, over the current muddle.

You will need to supply a Keys.java class that looks something like this:

public class Keys {
	public static final String TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY = "Your Consumer Key";
	public static final String TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET = "Your Consumer Secret";
}

This software is the result of the work of many others that I researched and is intended for educational purposes. This software is not intended to be a complete implementation.
